    "It appears that the random forest classifier has performed best at predicting which articles users will click on based on the click history of this sample. I may choose to increase my sample size from 1,000 to 10,000 in the future to see if additional data could improve accuracy. Moreover, the objective of this project was not to provide users with an algorithm that feeds them articles they would click, but rather, one that also exposes them to news sources outside their information bubble. I will move forward discussing with my mentor how to use additional algorithms and/or steps to implement this stated goal. Also, may do a bayesian grid search for the Random Forest model next. "
